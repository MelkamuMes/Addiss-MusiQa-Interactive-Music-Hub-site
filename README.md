## About the Developer

**[Melkamu Mesene]**

I built this project as part of the Addiss Software Internship Challenge. The primary goal was to create an interactive and user-friendly music hub that meets modern web standards. This site was developed using React for the frontend and Node.js with Sequelize for the backend, providing a full-stack solution for managing and playing music.
